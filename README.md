# python-programming-exercises-gently-explained-solutions

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the book *Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained* by Al Sweigart. The exercises cover a wide range of programming concepts and are designed to help beginners practice and improve their Python skills.
